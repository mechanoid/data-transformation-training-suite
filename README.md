## JS Data-Transformation Training

Some tests to get used to map, reduce and other data transformation methods in
JS.

### Usage

Clone the repo, and run the tests. All fail. Make them happy :)

```
deno test
```

TIPP!!: You can run single tests by filtering for the test name

```
deno test --filter "indexes"
```
